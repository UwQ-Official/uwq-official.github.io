# [UwQ_'s Buses](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3355235212)

## List of program codes with visualisation
Keep in mind, that ones that end in "_" (underscore) are automatic and only supported on buses/trolleybuses with RGB displays.

Codes consist of a letter (**b**, **t** or **e**) and a line id (1-4 numbers). The first one/two/three numbers indicate the line itself and the last number the direction (for example **b85**1 is to Hadzhi Dimitar and **b85**2 is from H. Dimitar to Vrabnitsa-2).

The letters are:
- **b** - <ins>B</ins>us lines
- **t** - <ins>T</ins>rolleybus lines
- **e** - Tram lines (the *e* stands for electric)
- There are also ones that don't follow that pattern and are either words or abbreviations (like *bus*, *test*, *school*, *ter* /<ins>ter</ins>oll/, *bt* /<ins>b</ins>lue<ins>t</ins>ide/, etc.)

A common pattern is that company logos/for depot signs are in range between 9900 and 9999 (like b9990, b9999, t9999, t9990 t9992, e9999); Special destinations (mostly present on buses) like trolleybus/tram/train replacements are usually in the 7000-8999 range, with some exceptions like the school bus (b6666) and special holiday bus (b6665).

## Route information displays

Buses with destination and stops displays are automatic and support *most* lines. They show the time since the level has started and the line number. For unsupported lines only the time will be shown and the line number field will be empty.
