# [UwQ_'s Buses](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3355235212)

## List of program codes with visualisation
**Keep in mind, that ones that end in "_" (underscore) are automatic and only supported on buses/trolleybuses with RGB displays.**

Codes consist of a letter (**b**, **t** or **e**) and a line id (1-4 numbers). The first one/two/three numbers indicate the line itself and the last number the direction (for example **b85**1 is to the 1st destination and **b85**2 is to the 2nd destination).

The letters are:
- **b** - <ins>B</ins>us lines
- **t** - <ins>T</ins>rolleybus lines (Higher resolution [more info](#more-info))
- **e** - Tram lin<ins>e</ins>s
- There are also ones that don't follow that pattern and are either words or abbreviations (like *bus*, *test*, *school*, *ter* /<ins>ter</ins>oll/, *bt* /<ins>b</ins>lue<ins>t</ins>ide/, etc.)

If you hold down the **Page Down** key, you will see a new input field. In it you need to enter additional destination / text ID (for now you'l have to find them manually, [more-info](#additional)).

<!-- Ones that start with "**s_**" will display text only on the front display while the others will only display the line number. -->

A common pattern is that company logos/*for depot* signs are in range between 9900 and 9999 (like b9990, b9999, t9999, t9990 t9992, e9999); Special destinations (mostly present on buses) like trolleybus/tram/train replacements are usually in the 7000-8999 range, with some exceptions like the school bus (b6666) and special holiday bus (b6665).

Due to recent changes from the Sofia IBIS team, most temporary lines (with an **A** (like 86A, 79A, 108A, etc.)) now start with an **8** (86A -> 886*1*, 79A -> 879*1*, 108A -> 808*1*). This also applies to trolleybus lines.

## Route information displays

Buses with destination and stops displays are automatic and support *most* lines. They show the time since the level has started and the line number. For unsupported lines only the time will be shown and the line number field will be empty.

## More info
### Trolleybus display resolution
Trolleybuses' LED displays ([mostly](#useless-info)) consist of [bustec](https://bustec.eu/en/) ones, unlike the [Mobitec (Luminator)](https://www.luminator.com/en-uk/products/on-board-destination-displays.html) ones (of buses) using 128/96/32 x 16 px, bustec uses 144/108/36 x 19 px. display. To match as closely as possible to the IRL ones, the trolleybuses use these resolutions, meaning, that a trolley sign won't fit on a bus and vice-versa.

### Useless info
Trolleybuses Skoda 26Tr Solaris II (the non-articulated ones, probably the yellow Ikarus-es too) use [BUSE](https://www.buse.cz/en) displays, not bustec.

Some buses (depending on the brand/bus itself) also use bustec displays, but it would be a pain in the ass to make them too. That's why (for now) only trolleybuses are different (incomaptible with others).

#### Additional
Additional codes work the same way as ordinary ones. Letter + number.

E.g. **b7**, **t10**, etc.

For now they're not shown on the bottom of the preview because of some software limitations (my python script doesn't like them ðŸ™ƒ).
