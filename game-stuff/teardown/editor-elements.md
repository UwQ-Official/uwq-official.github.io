## Overall

Format:

> property (type) - description \[default values\]

Most elements have these properties:

> name (string) - name to show in editor 
>
> template (string) - template id to apply
>
> tags (string, list) - list of tags (separated by spaces)
>
> pos (vec) - position in world \[0.0 0.0 0.0\]
>
> rot (vec) - rotation \[0 0 0\]

# scene

>
> ### version (version) {invisible} - game version in which the level was last saved
>
> name
> 
> template
>
> tags - doesn't matter, doesn't exist
>
> pos
>
> rot
>
> ### shadowVolume (vec) - Area in which shadows will be cast and proper lighting will exist

The scene contains the entire level's components. One scene per level.

A outline of a box with a gray grid on the bottom.

**OR**:

# prefab

### Element is invisible, but differentiates between normal level and instance

> ### version (version) {invisible} - game version in which the level was last saved

# animator

> name
>
> template
>
> tags
>
> pos
>
> rot
>
> ### file (full path) - xml file

Used for rigs and animations.

Invisible unless clicked, a box with white outlines

# body

> name
>
> template
>
> tags
>
> pos
>
> rot
>
> ### dynamic (bool) - if body is dynamic or not \[âœ“ true\]
>
> ### desc (string) - description (text appears at the bottom of the screen when looking at body)

Used to group shapes toghether while being detectable by scripts (unlike *group*s).

Invisible unless clicked, a box with white outlines

# boundary

>
> ### padtop (number) - top padding \[5\]

Adds 4 walls surrounding you that prevent you from exiting the map area (going out of the boundary sometimes crashes the game).
